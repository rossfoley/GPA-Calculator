GPA Calculator
- Created by Ross Foley

======== Introduction ==========
This application was created to solve the problem that Lewis Mills doesn't provide an easy way to calculate your GPA.  While the formula to do so is available in your student handbook, there has never been an automated way to calculate your GPA.
This application is designed to make it easy for you to calculate and maintain your GPA information.  After signing up, you can add all of your classes and fill in some basic information such as level, grade, and credits to calculate your GPA.  It is easy to update your grades if they change since you first entered them so you can always know what your up-to-date GPA is.  In addition, it also provides you with your Honor Role status, so you will always know whether you have made High Honors, Honors, or Honorable Mention.
